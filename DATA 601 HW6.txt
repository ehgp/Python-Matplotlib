•Task 1: Acquire power data (source) for at least 10 days and not more than 40 days. Load the data into a Jupyter Notebook. 
Create two bar graphs of the power consumption per hour. One bar graph has 24 bars; one bar graph has 24*(number of days) bars. 
Submit the .ipynb file containing the analysis and the generated pictures.

•Task 2: Simulate a fair die and a biased 6-sided die. The biased die has probabilities {0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.25}. 
Create a visualization that compares outcomes of multiple rolls of a fair die and this biased die. 
You can use a single visualization or multiple visualizations to demonstrate the difference in outcomes for the dice. 
The user of your notebook should be able to alter the number of simulations as an argument to a function.

The system demand shown on this graph is the total instantaneous MW demand being supplied across England, Wales and Scotland. 
It is estimated from the generation data (Instantaneous Generation by Fuel Type) by summing the output of all the generation 
connected to the GB Transmission System (including Embedded Large Power Stations), plus imports from External Interconnectors e.g. 
from France-GB and Ireland-GB. Negative values for the Interconnector and Pumped-Storage and Non-Pumped-Storage Hydro types are set 
to 0 in the summation step.
