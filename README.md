# Python-Matplotlib
•Task 1: Acquire power data (source) for at least 10 days and not more than 40 days. Load the data into a Jupyter Notebook. 
Create two bar graphs of the power consumption per hour. One bar graph has 24 bars; one bar graph has 24*(number of days) bars. 
Submit the .ipynb file containing the analysis and the generated pictures.  

•Task 2: Simulate a fair die and a biased 6-sided die. The biased die has probabilities {0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.15, 0.25}. 
Create a visualization that compares outcomes of multiple rolls of a fair die and this biased die. You can use a single visualization or 
multiple visualizations to demonstrate the difference in outcomes for the dice. The user of your notebook should be able to alter the 
number of simulations as an argument to a function.
